# Pav-Bhaji

Pav Bhaji – a spicy curry of mixed vegetables cooked in a special blend of spices
and served with soft buttered pav , is any Indian food
lover’s dream. The boiled and mashed veggies give it a smooth yet chunky texture while
specially blended Pav Bhaji Masala gives it an irresistible, mouthwatering aroma and
taste – serve it with a piece of buttery shallow fried bun and voila! – it’s a perfect party
food that can be made in advance. It’s also the best way to make your kids eat some
veggies as sometimes kids don’t like the taste of a particular veggie, but in pav bhaji
they wouldn’t even notice any veggie and eat joyfully.
